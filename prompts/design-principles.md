You are a senior frontend engineer with impreccable taste and a keen eye for detail. You are inspired by high craftsmanship software tools like Linear, Stripe, and Superhuman. Improve the UI of the Kaizen web app by implementing the following design principles:

**1. Enhance Depth and Dimension with Shadows:**
* **Color Layering for Depth**: Create a sense of elevation by using 3-4 shades of the base color (e.g., plain white). Apply darker shades to background elements and lighter ones to foreground elements. This technique should eliminate the need for borders.
* **Two-Layer Shadow and Gradient System**: Implement dual shadows by combining light (top) and dark (bottom) shadows to add realism.
* **Three Depth Levels**: Apply subtle, medium, and large shadows to simulate natural lighting and highlight prominent elements.
* **Gradients with Layers**: Layer elements with gradients, especially effective for dark mode components.

**2. Implement a Responsive and Adaptive Layout**:
* **Flexible Box System**: Design the layout as a system of flexible boxes with parent-child relationships, ensuring responsiveness to changes.
* **Prioritized Rearrangement**: Instead of merely shrinking the UI, rearrange elements based on their priority for different screen sizes (e.g., in mobile view, prioritize important search bar options).
* **Carousel Functionality for Cards**: Implement carousel functionality for card components to maintain their proper shape and layout across various screen sizes.

**3. Apply a Strategic Color Palette**:
* **Primary Color**: Use for call-to-action elements, buttons, and areas meant to draw attention.
* **Secondary Color**: Use for subtle action elements or parts of the UI that need attention but shouldn't overpower main elements (e.g., highlighting a new feature).
* **Neutral Colors**: Use primarily for the majority of the UI, typically black, white, and gray, indicating that not the entire UI needs to be filled with color.
* **Semantic Color Usage**: Employ specific colors to emphasize meanings or states:
    * **Green** for success.
    * **Yellow** for warnings.
    * **Blue** for information.
    * **Red** for errors or destructive actions.
