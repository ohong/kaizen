**Subject:** Check-in: How is your developer workflow feeling? (5 min)

Hi team,

We're running a quick pulse on how engineering feels about our current developer experience, especially with AI tooling in the mix. Your candid responses help us double-click into what's working and what needs better support.

Please reply directly to this email with short answers (bullet points are perfect!) for the prompts below. Everything will be synthesized - individual responses stay private.

---

1. Think back over the last sprint. Where did our tooling or AI helpers accelerate you, and where did they slow you down?
2. Describe how supported you felt when tackling your toughest task last week. What made it smooth or painful?
3. When AI suggestions show up, how confident do you feel accepting them? What follow-up review steps do you take?
4. How has AI changed how you collaborate - code reviews, pairing, or asking questions? Any new friction?
5. What's one improvement that would make your developer workflow feel meaningfully better?

Thanks for taking a few minutes to share - it shapes what we prioritize next.
