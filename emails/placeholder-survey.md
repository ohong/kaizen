**Subject: Quick check-in: How's AI tooling working for you? (5 questions, ~5 min)**

Hi team,

We're gathering feedback on how AI coding tools (Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT, etc.) are affecting your day-to-day work. This isn't about proving AI is good or bad—we genuinely want to understand what's working and what's creating friction.

**Please reply to this email with your thoughts on these 5 questions.** No need for essays—candid, stream-of-consciousness answers are perfect.

---

**1. Think about your last sprint/week. Describe one task where AI helped you and one where it slowed you down or got in the way.**

*[We're looking for: specific task types, context on when AI adds/subtracts value - maps to Performance, Activity]*

---

**2. How does using AI tools affect your energy and focus during the day? Do you find yourself more or less mentally tired? More or less in flow?**

*[We're looking for: cognitive load, flow state impact, satisfaction signals - maps to Satisfaction & Wellbeing, Efficiency & Flow]*

---

**3. Walk me through what happens after AI generates code for you. How much time do you spend reviewing it? How often do you accept it as-is vs. heavily modify it vs. scrap it entirely?**

*[We're looking for: actual workflow patterns, quality/reliability perceptions, hidden time costs - maps to Activity, Efficiency & Flow, Performance]*

---

**4. Has AI changed how you collaborate with teammates—for better or worse? (Think: code reviews, pairing, knowledge sharing, onboarding, etc.)**

*[We're looking for: team dynamics, communication patterns, knowledge transfer - maps to Communication & Collaboration]*

---

**5. If you could snap your fingers and fix one thing about how AI tools work in your workflow, what would it be?**

*[We're looking for: pain points, unmet needs, priorities for improvement - maps to all SPACE dimensions]*

---

**Reminder:** We're not sharing individual responses—we'll synthesize themes and share aggregate insights with the team.

Thanks for the input,
